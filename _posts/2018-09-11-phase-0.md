## Phase 0 : Problem and Mission Statements
**Social Impact**

*Problem Statement:*
* "People are unaware of corporate practices harming emerging markets"

*Mission Statement:*
* EthicScore’s mission is to redefine the way consumers view social impact and ethical practices by corporations against emerging markets. We will educate younger consumers on the unethical corporate practices by creating a chrome web extension that provides ratings of these corporations’ practices based on a scale ranging from 0-100. 0 will be the lowest score meaning poor practices while 100 will be highest score that a corporation can receive. 

## Roles
* Caroline Chong - Evaluation Lead
* Vivien Chen - Design Lead
* Joshua Kim - Research Lead
* Benjamin Ormond - Prototyping Lead
* Nathan Park - Project Manager

## Research/Analysis
* **Process** - We searched online for news articles about consumer trends in ethically sourced goods and popular commerce platforms currently in use.

* **Findings** - We found that younger consumers are diving a shift towards more ethically sourced goods. This isn't limited to just buying preferences - the younger generation is also more interested in working for companies that take ethics in their workplace seriously, and more commonly want to work for companies that produce ethically. This trend is becoming more apparent with younger age groups, with "Generation Z" being the most environmentally and socially conscious consumer market, even more so than millenials. Though some developed markets have ethical accreditations that certify products as ethically sourced, it takes time on the customer's behalf to look for the labels.

When consumers do see these labels, some lesser-known labels can confuse and overwhelm prospective customers. In a survey, though 82% of respondents were aware of Fairtrade, only 3% were aware of LEAF (Linking Environment and Farming). Information about corporate practices though available, isn't presented in a way that is easily understandable by consumers [(Source)](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/27/ethical-food-labelling-which-survey).
<br/><br/> 
Half of all purchases are made online, and this trend is increasing with each year. This reveals a troubling issue, where even if customers do understand potentially confusing labels on a company's business practices, they may be unable to view the label when shopping online - even if the information may be somewhere on the webpage, it may be non-obivious to a typical consumer [(Source)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/06/08/survey-more-than-half-purchases-made-online/85592598/).  
 
## Design
* **Process** -For our design process we all did research about which target market would care the most about the social impact and ethical practices by corporations against emerging markets. We then brainstormed various ideas of what product we would create and which would be best for this target market. We considered an app solely dedicated for finding ethical companies with a huge list where you can tap on a company and then see more information about their corporate practices and the global effects of them. However, we realized that most users are unlikely to download an app that is solely for this purpose, or even find out about this app by searching in the App Store.

* Thus, we then considered a web page to inform users of corporations that are ethical and not ethical with our own unique ranking system based on certain factors such as global impact, impact on marginalized groups, ethical labor practices, etc. However, it would be difficult to gain traction for this website alone. Since half of all purchases are made online and this number is increasing yearly we decided to create something online that would be used during the process of online shopping.

* **Design description and rationale** - We finally decided that a google chrome extension that pops up on various ecommerce websites would be the best solution because a user can just download it once and then on any store website that they visit they can simply click the icon and it’ll pop up information about the ethics of this corporation. From our research since younger consumers enjoy purchasing ethical products we should design an aesthetic but also very simple and intuitive product that young consumers can use. Therefore we decided to design a browser extension. We will first probably design this browser extension for the Google Chrome Extension Store because most young consumers use this browser frequently and this is the biggest Extension Market. To make this extension’s usability even easier, the extension icon will display this corporation’s score as the extension icon that is beside the browser bar. We had wanted to make the pop up automatic (without clicking the extension icon) whenever a user visits an ecommerce site, but after discussion with our group members we decided that extensions we have used prior with that functionality were deemed annoying and shortly disabled after a few uses.

* For our final design we decided to not include the corporation name because it will be evident from the website url that the user is on. The score will be easy to understand from a glance. 0 - 100 for easy understanding and in a big circle that is colored either red 0- 24 Poor - Blue, 25-49 Below Average - Yellow, 50-74 - Orange, Above Average 75 - 100 Excellent - Green. We then will link some articles about the corporation’s ethical practices on the side for users to learn more details about recent events such as Amazon’s recent labor strike.

## Prototyping

<img width="400px"height="300px" alt="InVision Prototype" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jushkem/team-elephant/master/_posts/InvisionScreenshot.png" />

* **Process** - The prototyping process essentially consisted of the of synthesizing the design process into a prototype that could be tested within the confines of our rapid cycle. The first of these prototypes was a series of whiteboard wireframes that gave us a general idea of what our prototype would look like based upon the design specifications. From there, we used InVision, a free app designed for prototype to give it basic functionality. This allowed us to have something for users to physically click through in the evaluation portion. In the context of the UX textbook, we followed something closer to the horizontal prototype structure in that  we showed a big picture view of what our product would do without all of the specific details behind the scenes.

The figure on the left is when our team brainstormed designs on a whiteboard. The figure on the left is a nicer looking prototype made with InVision. The link to the prototype is down below.

## Evaluation
* **Process** - To evaluate our prototype, we received feedback from UVA students. Below is the blurb we recited (to give an idea of what our project does) before asking the questions in the chart.


|**Name**|**What is the objective of this product?**|**Do you think it is easily accessible from your web browsers?**|**What do you like about this? What do you not like?**|**On a scale of 1-10, was the display understandable?**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Erwin|Score is correlated with ethical goodness|No, bad design, you’ll eventually forget its there (hypeness will be gone)|Want it to pop up instead of us clicking on it|7|
|Angeline|To rank companies’ ethicalness|Yes, if I know the link|Likes the attached news articles, doesn’t like how the score is created, how ppl behind the scenes are ranking it|8|
|Emily|Trying to give company score, gives examples of what company does|Yes|Likes the big score (easy to score), Wish I knew what the score was based on, does it work with other sites (company vs. regular)? Don't know when to use|8|
|Chris|To give a rating|Yes|Top half could be smaller, contain more info|7|
|Nick|Rates companies|Seems like it, yes|Looks good overall, likes color scheme, looks clean, some clutter with articles|7.5|
|Wade|To give a score on the ethicalness of the company|Yes, it’s in the toolbar|Easily readable and includes sources on how it came up with the rating|9|
|Marina|To provide a score based on the ethics of the website|Yes|Likes how simple it is, value is clear and shows up immediately, doesn’t like scrolling of articles|8|
|Thrishna|Provide ethical analysis|Yes|Small articles but title is huge|7|


* **Findings** - We learned that the design is mostly effective. Some people were stumped by how the extension would work because the mockup done in InVision wasn’t 100% clear. The majority thought that EthicScore would be easily accessible through a web browser. Most said that the large score in the top half of the pop up was clear and easy to read but that there were some wasted white space that could have been utilized to make the bottom half (the articles) less crowded. Overall, when asked on a scale 1-10 (with 10 being the easiest to understand) how understandable this design is, all 9 students gave a score of 7 or above.
