## Roles
* Caroline Chong - Evaluation Lead
* Vivien Chen - Design Lead
* Joshua Kim - Research Lead
* Benjamin Ormond - Prototyping Lead
* Nathan Park - Project Manager

## Research/Analysis
* **Process** - We searched online and read news articles about consumer trends in ethically sourced goods and commerce platforms.
* **Findings** - We found that younger consumers are diving a shift towards more ethically sourced goods. This isn't limited to just buying preferences - the younger generation is also more interested in working for companies that take ethics in their workplace seriously, and more commonly want to work for companies that produce ethically [(Source)](https://www.ft.com/content/8b08bf4c-e5a0-11e7-8b99-0191e45377ec). Half of all purchases are made online, and this trend is increasing with each year [(Source)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/06/08/survey-more-than-half-purchases-made-online/85592598/).  

## Design
* **Process** -For our design process we all did research about which target market would care the most about the social impact and ethical practices by corporations against emerging markets. We then brainstormed various ideas of what product we would create and which would be best for this target market. We considered an app solely dedicated for finding ethical companies with a huge list where you can tap on a company and then see more information about their corporate practices and the global effects of them. However, we realized that most users are unlikely to download an app that is solely for this purpose, or even find out about this app by searching in the App Store.

Thus, we then considered a web page to inform users of corporations that are ethical and not ethical with our own unique ranking system based on certain factors such as global impact, impact on marginalized groups, ethical labor practices, etc. However, it would be difficult to gain traction for this website alone. Since half of all purchases are made online and this number is increasing yearly we decided to create something online that would be used during the process of online shopping.
* **Design description and rationale** - We finally decided that a google chrome extension that pops up on various ecommerce websites would be the best solution because a user can just download it once and then on any store website that they visit they can simply click the icon and it’ll pop up information about the ethics of this corporation. From our research since younger consumers enjoy purchasing ethical products we should design an aesthetic but also very simple and intuitive product that young consumers can use. Therefore we decided to design a browser extension. We will first probably design this browser extension for the Google Chrome Extension Store because most young consumers use this browser frequently and this is the biggest Extension Market. To make this extension’s usability even easier, the extension icon will display this corporation’s score as the extension icon that is beside the browser bar. We had wanted to make the pop up automatic (without clicking the extension icon) whenever a user visits an ecommerce site, but after discussion with our group members we decided that extensions we have used prior with that functionality were deemed annoying and shortly disabled after a few uses.

For our final design we decided to not include the corporation name because it will be evident from the website url that the user is on. The score will be easy to understand from a glance. 0 - 100 for easy understanding and in a big circle that is colored either red 0- 24 Poor - Blue, 25-49 Below Average - Yellow, 50-74 - Orange, Above Average 75 - 100 Excellent - Green. We then will link some articles about the corporation’s ethical practices on the side for users to learn more details about recent events such as Amazon’s recent labor strike.

## Prototyping

* **Process** - The prototyping process essentially consisted of the of synthesizing the design process into a prototype that could be tested within the confines of our rapid cycle. The first of these prototypes was a series of whiteboard wireframes that gave us a general idea of what our prototype would look like based upon the design specifications. From there, we used InVision, a free app designed for prototype to give it basic functionality. This allowed us to have something for users to physically click through in the evaluation portion. In the context of the UX textbook, we followed something closer to the horizontal prototype structure in that  we showed a big picture view of what our product would do without all of the specific details behind the scenes.

The figure on the left is when our team brainstormed designs on a whiteboard. The figure on the left is a nicer looking prototype made with InVision. The link to the prototype is down below.

## Evaluation
* **Process** - To evaluate our prototype, we received feedback from UVA students. Below is the blurb we recited (to give an idea of what our project does) before asking the questions in the chart.

* **Findings** - We learned that the design is mostly effective. Some people were stumped by how the extension would work because the mockup done in InVision wasn’t 100% clear. The majority thought that EthicScore would be easily accessible through a web browser. Most said that the large score in the top half of the pop up was clear and easy to read but that there were some wasted white space that could have been utilized to make the bottom half (the articles) less crowded. Overall, when asked on a scale 1-10 (with 10 being the easiest to understand) how understandable this design is, all 9 students gave a score of 7 or above.
