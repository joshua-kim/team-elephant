## Research/Analysis
* **Process** - We searched online and read news articles about consumer trends in ethically sourced goods and commerce platforms.
* **Findings** - We found that younger consumers are diving a shift towards more ethically sourced goods. This isn't limited to just buying preferences - the younger generation is also more interested in working for companies that take ethics in their workplace seriously, and more commonly want to work for companies that produce ethically [(Source)](https://www.ft.com/content/8b08bf4c-e5a0-11e7-8b99-0191e45377ec).
