## Roles
* Caroline Chong - Evaluation Lead
* Vivien Chen - Design Lead
* Joshua Kim - Research Lead
* Benjamin Ormond - Prototyping Lead
* Nathan Park - Project Manager

## Research/Analysis
* **Process** - We searched online and read news articles about consumer trends in ethically sourced goods and commerce platforms.
* **Findings** - We found that younger consumers are diving a shift towards more ethically sourced goods. This isn't limited to just buying preferences - the younger generation is also more interested in working for companies that take ethics in their workplace seriously, and more commonly want to work for companies that produce ethically [(Source)](https://www.ft.com/content/8b08bf4c-e5a0-11e7-8b99-0191e45377ec). Half of all purchases are made online, and this trend is increasing with each year [(Source)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/06/08/survey-more-than-half-purchases-made-online/85592598/).

* **Process** - The prototyping process essentially consisted of the of synthesizing the design process into a prototype that could be tested within the confines of our rapid cycle. The first of these prototypes was a series of whiteboard wireframes that gave us a general idea of what our prototype would look like based upon the design specifications. From there, we used InVision, a free app designed for prototype to give it basic functionality. This allowed us to have something for users to physically click through in the evaluation portion. In the context of the UX textbook, we followed something closer to the horizontal prototype structure in that  we showed a big picture view of what our product would do without all of the specific details behind the scenes.

The figure on the left is when our team brainstormed designs on a whiteboard. The figure on the left is a nicer looking prototype made with InVision. The link to the prototype is down below.
